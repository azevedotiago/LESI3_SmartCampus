### QUESTÃO:
Credit Card Customers Prediction Credit Card Customers Prediction will give up in python code with kmeans, cluster and association with these parameters:
CLIENTNUM	Client number
Customer_Age	Demographic variable - Customer's Age in Years
Gender	Demographic variable - M=Male, F=Female
Dependent_count	Demographic variable - Number of dependents
Education_Level	Demographic variable - Educational Qualification of the account holder (example: high school, college graduate, etc.)
Marital_Status	Demographic variable - Married, Single, Divorced, Unknown
Income_Category	Demographic variable - Annual Income Category of the account holder (< $40K, $40K - 60K, $60K - $80K, $80K-$120K, >
Card_Category	Product Variable - Type of Card (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
Months_on_book	Period of relationship with bank
Total_Relationship_count	Total no. of products held by the customer
Months_Inactive_12_mon	No. of months inactive in the last 12 months
Contacts_Count_12_mon	No. of Contacts in the last 12 months
Credit_Limit	Credit Limit on the Credit Card
Total_Revolving_Bal	Total Revolving Balance on the Credit Card
Avg_Open_To_Buy	Open to Buy Credit Line (Average of last 12 months)
Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1	Change in Transaction Amount (Q4 over Q1)
Total_Trans_Amt	Total Transaction Amount (Last 12 months)
Total_Trans_Ct	Total Transaction Count (Last 12 months)
Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1	Change in Transaction Count (Q4 over Q1)
Avg_Utilization_Ratio	Average Card Utilization Ratio
Naive_Bayes_Classifier_attribution	Naive Bayes
Naive_Bayes_Classifier_attribution	Naive Bayes

### RESPOSTA:
Importing required libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib
Loading the data and cleaning it, handling missing values and categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data to understand the distribution and relationships between the variables
Applying k-means clustering on the dataset
Applying association rule mining on the dataset
Building a Naive Bayes classifier and training it on the dataset
Using the classifier to make predictions on new data
Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
It's important to note that this is a simplified version of the steps that would be involved in developing such a code, in real-world scenarios, it would require a lot more testing, fine-tuning, and validation.
